### 👨‍💻 Bio

👨‍💻 I'm a Senior Fullstack Engineer with 20+ years of experience building and maintaining web applications for international agencies and enterprise clients.  
🧠 I work across the stack — from PHP and WordPress backends to React and TypeScript frontends — delivering robust, scalable, and maintainable solutions.  
⚙️ I enjoy understanding systems end-to-end, solving tricky technical issues, and improving performance.  
🌎 I'm a European citizen based in Brazil, collaborating remotely with teams across the US, UK, and EU.

💡 I've worked on both **legacy and modern systems**, from optimizing large-scale WordPress infrastructures to building **headless CMS** projects powered by React, Next.js, and GraphQL.  
🧰 I’m also comfortable digging into things like caching, redirects, Cloudflare setups, or debugging PHP/JS issues that affect production systems.

🎨 I love clean architecture and well-structured code. I’ve built custom Gutenberg blocks, REST and GraphQL integrations, and reusable component libraries with React and Tailwind CSS.  
🤓 I’m also a bit of a nerd for regex, SQL optimization, and debugging tools — I like understanding *why* things break as much as fixing them.

🗣️ I speak 🇬🇧 English, 🇮🇹 Italian, 🇪🇸 Spanish, and 🇧🇷 Portuguese fluently.

### 🔥 Hobbies

🎲 Boardgames enthusiast.  
📜 I love handmade notebooks and traditional printing (letterpress, bookbinding).  
⛺ I enjoy road trips and tracking every place I visit — including distance and expenses (I’m a data nerd even on vacation).  
📷 Photography lover, currently shooting with a Fuji mirrorless — I have a soft spot for urban exploration and abandoned places.
